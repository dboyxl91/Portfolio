            <h3>Portfolios are very important!</h3>
            <p>
                Portfolios are important in regards to my intended career 
                because I am graduating with a bachlors in I.T. which
                is a broad degree so the portfolio would showcase my 
                knowledge and in what I do best. A portfolio shows what 
                you do best in a clear and concise way.
            </p>
            <h3>What do you need to include?</h3>
            <p>
                In your portfolio you should have a number of things 
                documented. The first part of your portfolio should 
                include a summary of accomplishments, skills, and past 
                experience. The next part of your portfolio you should 
                include what you do in your career, how you act in a 
                professional enviroment, and what you bring that others
                don't. You should also always include a section about 
                yourself and the story of what brought you to where you
                are today.
